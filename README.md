** Hi! This is your jump start grunt js boilerplate. **

Here are the instructions you should follow in the proper order.

* Add these files to the root of the project. (its better to include it in the root or otherwise you have to navigate to the certain folder to run grunt)
* Run this command in your terminal `npm init`
* Add the path to the `path` area in **Gruntfile.js**  (Search for TODO)
* Add the files in the order for it to be compiled in the `src` area in **Gruntfile.js**  (Search for TODO)
* The main sass file is named **site.sass** and the main js file is named **app.js**.
* Give the proper names for the project, git repository and version.
* after completing the initialization, run this command `npm install`
* Everything will get installed. Meanwhile, Do some **Push Ups** or **Jumping Jacks**
* Don't forget to point the `node_modules/` and `.sass-cache/*` to your .gitignore file.
* 


**Happy Grunting**
