** Hi! This is your jump start grunt js boilerplate. **

Here are the instructions you should follow in the proper order.

* You can work on this as a project or copy package.json file and gruntfile.js to your project root. (its better to include it in the root. Otherwise you have to navigate to the certain folder to run grunt)
* Run this command in your terminal `npm init`
* Add the path to the `path` area in **Gruntfile.js**  (Search for TODO)
* The main sass file is named **site.sass** and the main js file is named **app.js**.
* Add the files in the order for it to be compiled in the `src` area in **Gruntfile.js**  (Search for TODO)
* Give the proper names for the project, git repository and version.
* after completing the initialization, run this command `npm install`
* Everything will get installed. Meanwhile, Do some **Push Ups** or **Jumping Jacks**

**Happy Grunting**
